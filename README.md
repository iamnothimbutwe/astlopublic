# astlo


>..AFRICASOVEREIGNTECH..



I have an idea for Astlo. The long term aim of this feature is to allow later generations to access data of past generations. Imagine knowing how a town, an ancestor, a plant or memories from a random person looked like while also knowing the true states of Earth or the Sun or Pluto right now or millions and billions of years into the future or past.

- Anyone shares pictures of Planet Earth because Anything/Everything on Planet Earth is a Feature of Planet Earth.
- Memories, Plants, People, Life, history, anything about Earth.

Do you get it?




The internal custom ephemeris part (the solar system objects real-time tracking part) for astlo feels done to me. 

Now i should dive into other Astrophysics Topics.

wanna help??





v12.0.0 features..

The following are just the top/front-end features of version v12.0.0 - public..
For the full explanation of what and how Astlo works, The documentation is under creation.

- Tracking of any Earth satellite X relative any position in the world provided you know the NORAD number of the satellite, Your Geodetic coordinates namely: latitude=(North or South) longitude=(East or West) altitude=(if meters or kilometers, Astlo will be guide the user. This means it can tell you where satellite X is in your local sky and horizon in real-time. Of clurse this feature requires an internet connection for the NORAD number lookup
    
- a beta internal module still on experimentation using google earthengine-api to access and analyze Earth observation satellite data. 

- Topocentric coordinates of any solar system object including the moon provided you know your latitude, longitude and altitude Geodetic coordinate of your target location. This means it can twll you where the sun or Venus or the moon or any solar system object is in your local sky and horizon through elevation and azimuth angles. in real-time. Offline

- it tells the current moon face and phase and the illumination percentage and element.

- a dedicated module that tells the history and characteristics of any solar system object while also showing available images randomly. For Earth, random images of life, plants, houses and people activities may be shown randomly. This is because Everything on Earth is a feature of Earth. This feature makes Astlo to grow in size very much. The core engine remains <100KB

- rungekutta 4rth order intergration for precision and timestepping billions of years into the future and also the past. A sort of states time machine?







v7.112.173 features...
- Separate module mat. Handles all the 3D rendering and some 2D stuff and returns all the objects.
- module solexp handles the visuizations Eg the Specific mechanical energy against Distance from the Hiocenter, The real-time true anomaly visual for visualizing the current state of the system in one view. However, astlo handles both barycentric and Heliocentric frames
- module vect for ¦vectors¦ that handles vectors and other numeric arithmetics. It can be used seperatly in other imports. astlo ¦ CLI-SDK
- a growing module launchsims for experimenting with diffrent types of engines and mission planning.
- the command line interface command anmte now can show the real time 2D states of jupiter and the inner planets in one view.

### Features

*This are past features but they are still included in the full bundle.

- Real-time **barycentric** (SSB) and **heliocentric** position, velocity and gravitational acceleration vectors for **16 bodies**:
  - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto
  - Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, Haumea, Makemake, Eris
  - real-time position vectors of the Sun relative to the SSB barycenter due to all major planets. Although every Solar system object accounts for the SSB.
- **Perifocal (xy)**, **Heliocentric state vectors and state vectors relative SSB.
- Distances in **meters, kilometers, AU**
- **Light delay** (seconds + minutes) from Earth,SSB and Heliocenter
- Orbital velocity using real time velocity vectors relative SSB (m/s and km/s)
- **Mean anomaly** and **Eccentric anomaly**
- Full orbital period animation using **days + AU and seconds + AU**
- **Parallax angle**, distance in **parsecs**, **light years**
- **Specific orbital energy (E)** → automatically classifies orbit type:
  - Circle / Ellipse / Parabola / Hyperbola
- Terminal **orbit plotting** (eccentric orbits) using plotext 2D
- Optional 3D Real-time position Renders using matplotlib for the full 11 solar system objects, a 3D view of jupiter and the inner planets, a 3D view of the inner planets.
- Clean, colored terminal output with tables.

- Terminal plotting with plotext: in some orbits like Eris, Because Eris has a massive orbital inclination i approx 44°, it is "diving" deep below the ecliptic plane. the program only plots X and Y, you will be looking at the shadow of the orbit, not the actual 3D length. some of the distance is shifted to the Z axis.


### Installation

```
use pip install 'whl' to install the whl once downloaded.
```
